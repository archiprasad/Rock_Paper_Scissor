# Rock_Paper_Scissor
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, where you play against the computer. 

# The choices are as follows:
Rock,Paper and Scissors

# Key Features:
**Random Computer Choice:** The computer randomly selects between Rock, Paper, and Scissors each round.

**Player Input:** The player enters their choice using abbreviations (r for Rock, p for Paper, s for Scissors). The input is mapped to a numerical value for comparison.

**Outcome Display:** After both the player and computer have made their choices, the game displays:
The player's choice
The computer's choice
The outcome: Win, Lose, or Draw.

**Win/Loss Conditions:** The winner is determined by comparing the player and computer's choices according to the standard rules:
Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.

**Error Handling:** The program ensures valid input from the player and handles unexpected situations gracefully.

# How to Play:
Run the Python script.
Enter your choice (r for Rock, p for Paper, s for Scissors) when prompted.
The game will display both your choice and the computer's choice, followed by the result.
# Example:
If you choose Rock and the computer chooses Scissors, you win.
If both you and the computer choose the same option, it results in a draw.

This simple game is a great example of how to use conditionals and randomness in Python to create interactive experiences.
